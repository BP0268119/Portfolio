# Impact Evaluation 

## Executive Summary

The aim of this report is to demonstrate the impact that a piece of my work has had on my organisation. It exhibits some of the skills I have developed as a result of my learning on my Data Science apprenticeship. The piece I have selected is the creation of a dashboard which shows customers who have changed their contact details, called ‘Retailer Destination Number Changes’. 

The overall impact this work has had includes improved data quality and traceability for auditing purposes, a more streamlined process which has significantly reduced toil, enhanced insight into our customers’ behaviours, improved trust from consumers and reduced financial and reputational risk. 

## Project Background

The project was a result of a request raised by the Data Governance (DG) team because a concerning pattern of behaviour had been observed: customers who had yet to pay their bills, or who had been previously had their contract terminated by the organisation, were signing up for our services using false contact details to avoid being rejected or chased about their unpaid bills. Once they were signed up under these false details, they would then change those details back to their genuine contacts. 

This behaviour posed a financial and reputational risk to the organisation, as we aim to be a highly trusted and responsible organisation, which is only possible if those who sign up for our services are reputable and reliable. Therefore, addressing this issue was an urgent business priority. 

The project aimed to address several business challenges:

### Data Quality:
Initially, the DG team were manually searching through inconsistent and incomplete data, which reduced their capacity to find the offending customers as it was a long and laborious process, which also took time away from their other tasks. 

### Data Accessibility:
Data was siloed in various systems, making it challenging for teams to access and use data effectively.

### Analytics Efficiency:
The lack of streamlined data processes led to inefficiencies in the DG team’s workflows.
